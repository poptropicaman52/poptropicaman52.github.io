Graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with an Economics B.A. and interests in marketing, data science for financial analysis, operations management, and exploring different technical and non-technical pursuits. I enjoy working with my peers on coursework and side projects and spend my free time selling various items on eBay and managing two rental properties. I seek to deepen my understanding of data processing, learn new analytic methods to solve finance-related problems, and marketing experience.
